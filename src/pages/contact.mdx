		I'm on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Github. Keep track of [me on Github](https://github.com/Firestorm980/) to see what side projects I'm working on right now. [Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jonmchristensen) if you like hearing my nerdy thoughts about web, entertainment and other things. Unfortunately, I don't usually respond to [messages by owl](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Owl#Postal_workers).

		If you're looking for more official things, you can take a look at [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jon-christensen-2768381a/).
