SANUS is an established brand in the TV mount space. In fact, they’re the juggernaut of TV mounting. No one currently sells as many as they do. They’re goal is to educate the consumer on why they should mount and then help them best find a solution for that. But when you’re the biggest, sometimes you need to take things up a notch after awhile. SANUS has a new site that does just that.

## What was old, is new

SANUS had a lot of various tools on their old site to help people not only learn about mounting, but find the perfect mount for them. Unfortunately, the site had become outdated not only with the tools, but in their implementation and the site’s overall look. The new site helped launch the new branding initiative for SANUS.

## Any device, anywhere

The new site was built with responsive design in mind from the beginning, including their web tools. The new site featured a store locator and redesigned MountFinder and HeightFinder tools, which help people not only find a new mount that’ll work well with their TV, but also where to drill on the wall they want to mount on. All of these tools work with touch devices at a wide range of screen sizes, making it easy to use in any situation. There have also been tons of smaller site improvements to speed, UI and transitions, and organization to help enhance the experience even further for their users.
